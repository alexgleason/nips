Replies, Reposts, and Quote Posts in Text Events (kind 1).
--------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:unclebobmartin` `author:alexgleason`

## Abstract
This NIP describes how to use "e" and "p" tags in text events to denote replies, reposts, and quote posts.

## The "e" tag
Used to associate an event with another event.

`["e", <event-id>, <relay-url>, <marker>]`  
	
Where:

 * `<event-id>` is the id of the event being referenced.
 * `<relay-url>` is the URL of a recommended relay associated with the reference. Clients SHOULD add a valid `<relay-URL>` field, but may instead leave it as `""`.
 * `<marker>` is one of `"reply"` or `"mention"`.

 `<marker>` MUST be one of the following:

 - `"reply"` - when the note is a reply, and the ID refers to its parent.
 - `"mention"` - when the note is a quote post, and the ID refers to the quoted event.

When `"mention"` is used, the event content MUST include an index marker with the notation `#[index]` as specified in NIP-08, where the index matches the position of the `"e"` tag in the tags array. Note that a repost is a quote post without comment. For example, a quote post's content may look like `hello world\n#[0]`, while a repost would contain only `#[0]`.

Clients MUST NOT include multiple `"e"` tags with the same marker in an event. The order of "e" tags is not relevant.

## The "p" tag
Used in a text event contains a list of pubkeys used to record who is involved in a reply thread.

When replying to a text event E the reply event's "p" tags should contain all of E's "p" tags as well as the `"pubkey"` of the event being replied to.  

Example:  Given a text event authored by `a1` with "p" tags [`p1`, `p2`, `p3`] then the "p" tags of the reply should be [`a1`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`] 
in no particular order.
