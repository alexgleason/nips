Deleting a Pubkey
-----------------

`draft` `optional` `author:alexgleason`

Events of [kind `5`](09.md) may contain a "p" tag instead of "e" tags. The "p" tag MUST match the `pubkey` of the signed event, and this event indicates that the author wishes for relays and clients to stop showing events for this pubkey, and to reject future events from the pubkey.

### Client behavior

Clients which recieve a pubkey deletion event SHOULD treat all events from that pubkey as if they were deleted in accordance with [NIP-09](09.md).

Clients may give users the option to "Delete your account" with this type of event. Clients SHOULD display a prominent message explaining that the action is not reversible, and SHOULD require special confirmation such as requiring the user to type a message.

### Relay behavior

Relays receiving a pubkey deletion event MUST mark the pubkey as deleted, and MUST stop delivering events from this pubkey to clients, EXCEPT for events of kind `5`. Relays MAY delete events by this pubkey from their database, and SHOULD reject future events from the pubkey.

Relays SHOULD preserve events of kind `5` from the pubkey, as well as continue to collect and distribute events of kind `5`.
