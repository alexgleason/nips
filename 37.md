Language Tag
------------

`draft` `optional` `author:alexgleason`

A `lang` tag may be added to text events to indicate the language of the text. The value of the tag MUST be a valid [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code.

For example:

```json
["lang", "en"]
```

The language tag is a hint for automatic translations, as well as a tool for filtering by language. It is not a guarantee that the text is in the specified language. Some messages could contain text in multiple languages, text in a different language, or text in no language at all.

### Client behavior

Clients may append a `lang` tag based on the user's selection at the time of the post, or based on a user setting. If the user has not selected a language, the client should omit the `lang` tag.

### Relay behavior

Relays implementing this NIP should validate that the `lang` tag is a valid ISO 639-1 language code, and if so index the event so it can be requested with tag filters:

```json
["REQ", <subscription_id>, {"#lang": ["en"]}]
```
