Media Attachments
-----------------

`draft` `optional` `author:alexgleason`

Media attachments may be added to events with the `"media"` tag, in the form:

```
["media", <url>, <data, optional>]
```

Where:

- `<url>` is the URL of the media file.
- `<data>` (optional) is a stringified JSON object containing metadata about the media file.

### Data

The `data` field may contain any of the keys listed as tags in [NIP-94](./94.md). For example, `["m", "image/png"]` would become `{"m": "image/png"}` in the `data` field.

### Application behavior

Clients will typically display media attachments as thumbnail previews, separate from the content of the event.

Relays are not expected to index this tag.

### Examples

```json5
{
  "kind": 1,
  "content": "Been goin hard on the Open Source Software.",
  "tags": [
    [
      "media",
      "https://media.gleasonator.com/074862413a7fe1d18a2bee0f626280c8f795b392e9400419cc34ca4f3cb560ee.png",
